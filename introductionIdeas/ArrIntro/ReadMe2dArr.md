# Car Models Grid - C++ Program

This C++ program demonstrates the usage of a 2D array to represent car models in a grid format and prints them both individually and in a grid layout.

## Code Description

The code initializes a 2D array named `cars` that represents car models categorized by their manufacturers in a grid format. It displays the car models using individual `cout` statements and then prints the entire grid layout using nested loops.

## Code Structure

The C++ program comprises the following key components:

- Declaration and initialization of a 2D array (`cars`) to store car models categorized by manufacturers.
- Printing individual car models using multiple `cout` statements.
- Calculating the number of rows and columns in the 2D array to traverse it.
- Printing the entire grid layout of car models using nested `for` loops.

## Usage

1. Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable to see the car models displayed both individually and in a grid layout.

## Example Output

The program displays the car models in the following two formats:

- Individual display:

    ```
    Mustang, Escape, F-150
    Corvet, Silverado, Eqinox
    Corolla, Rav4, Land Cruiser
    ```

- Grid layout:

    ```
    Mustang Escape F-150
    Corvet Silverado Eqinox
    Corolla Rav4 Land Cruiser
    ```

## How to Run

1. Open a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and compile the code file (`car_models_grid.cpp`).
2. Execute the compiled program to observe the display of car models in both individual and grid layouts.
