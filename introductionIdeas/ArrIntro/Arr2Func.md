# About This C++ Program

This C++ program demonstrates the calculation of the total sum of prices stored in an array. It includes comments within the code for better understanding.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to showcase how to calculate the total sum of prices using an array in C++. It utilizes a simple function to iterate through the array and compute the total sum.

## Code Details

The program contains the following key elements:

- **`getTotal` Function:** This function takes in an array of prices and its size as parameters, then iterates through the array to calculate the total sum of prices.
- **Array of Prices:** An array named `prices` is defined, containing prices of various items as sample data.
- **Main Function:** The `main` function initializes the array of prices, calculates the total sum using the `getTotal` function, and displays the result.

## How to Use

1. **Compilation:** Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. **Execution:** Run the compiled program to calculate and display the total sum of prices.

## Additional Notes

- The program demonstrates the usage of arrays and functions in C++.
- Feel free to modify the array of prices or expand the code to suit different scenarios.
