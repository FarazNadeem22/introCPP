# Day Enum Example in C++

This C++ code demonstrates the usage of an enum (`Day`) to represent days of the week and uses a `switch` statement to print a message based on the current day.

## Code Description

The code contains an enum named `Day` with associated integer values representing each day of the week. It initializes a variable `today` with a specific day (`Tuesday` in this case) and uses a `switch` statement to print a corresponding message based on the day stored in the `today` variable.

## Code Structure

- `Day Enum Definition`: Defines an enum `Day` with values representing Sunday to Saturday.
- `Main Function`: Initializes the `today` variable with a specific day and uses a `switch` statement to print a message based on the day value.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable to see the message corresponding to the current day.

## Code Output

The code, when executed, displays a message corresponding to the day stored in the `today` variable using the `switch` statement.

## Example Output

- If `today` is `Tuesday`, the output will be: "It is Tuesday".

## How to Run

1. Open a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and compile the code file (`day_enum_example.cpp`).
2. Execute the compiled program to observe the message based on the current day.
